### 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

Objectives;
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs


A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure used to locate specific data within a collection of data.
It systematically explores a problem space to find a solution.
Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.
Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.
